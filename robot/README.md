# Robot Execution Failures Dataset

This dataset contains force and torque measurements on a robot after failure detection. Each failure is characterized by 15 force/torque samples collected at regular time intervals.

## Dataset Characteristics
- **Type**: Multivariate, Time-Series
- **Task**: Classification
- **Feature Type**: Integer
- **Subject Area**: Physics and Chemistry

## Dataset Composition
- **# Instances**: 463
- **# Features**: 90 (representing 15 force/torque samples over time)

### Measurements
Force and torque values recorded during robotic operation failures.

## Learning Problems
The dataset includes **five learning problems (LP)**, each associated with a specific type of robotic failure:

1. **LP1: Failures in Approach to Grasp Position**
   - Failures occurring during the robot's movement to grasp an object.

2. **LP2: Failures in Transfer of a Part**
   - Failures while the robot is transferring a part from one location to another.

3. **LP3: Position of Part After a Transfer Failure**
   - Identifies the position of a part after a failed transfer operation.

4. **LP4: Failures in Approach to Ungrasp Position**
   - Failures occurring during the robot's movement to release a part.

5. **LP5: Failures in Motion with Part**
   - Failures detected during motion while holding a part.

## Challenges
- **High Dimensionality**: 90 features per instance may lead to complex relationships in the data.
- **Time-Series Nature**: Force/torque values vary over 15 regular time intervals, making temporal relationships critical.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Potential differences in the number of failure instances across different tasks.

## Potential Use Cases
- **Fault Detection**: Automatically identifying failure types to improve robotic performance.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Anticipating failures to avoid operational downtime.
- **Robotics Research**: Developing algorithms to handle real-time data from sensors for decision-making.

## Recommended Analysis Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize/scale the force and torque values to ensure consistency.
   - Handle missing or noisy data, if any.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract temporal features or trends from the time-series data.
   - Use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to simplify high-dimensional data.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Time-series classification models (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs) to capture temporal dependencies.
   - Traditional classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) with extracted statistical features.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess classification performance.
